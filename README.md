# Josh Campbell's Portfolio
Hello recruiter or hiring manager! My name's Josh and I like Python, Docker, Linux, AWS, and beer. This is a curated list of projects I have on GitHub that I think you might be interested in. My full GitHub profile can be found [here](https://github.com/irlrobot) and [this is my Hackerrank profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/irlrobot) if you're into that sort of thing.

# Projects
## wings
https://github.com/irlrobot/wings

The goal of wings is to build and manage opinionated CI/CD toolchains for software projects using select AWS services with minimal configuration by the user. This means you take your existing source code, write a little bit of TOML, run wings, and get a full CI/CD pipeline using native AWS tools ([Code Suite services](https://aws.amazon.com/products/developer-tools/)) that cost next to nothing. Knowledge of the underlying services is not required. Spend more time coding and less time managing your CI/CD.

## lambda-chef-node-cleanup
https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-chef-node-cleanup

This little project watches for AWS CloudWatch events for EC2 instance termination to automatically remove nodes from Chef Server saving $$$. It's meant to run as an AWS Lambda function.

## aws_lambda_sample_events_python
https://github.com/awslabs/aws_lambda_sample_events_python

I wrote this in 2016 to help test Python functions running on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). It's also on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/aws-lambda-sample-events/).

## GARLC
https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-runcommand-configuration-management

I also worked on this while at AWS and legal wouldn't let me call it GARLC, so I had to call it lambda-runcommand-configuration-management. This was a POC to do continuous configuration management delivery (new marketing buzzword?!?! what have I done...) and was actually pretty fun to work on. Basically it uses AWS RunCommand to execute Ansible (in local mode) on hosts without actually needing SSH access anywhere (needs IAM Role). It even has a friggin' [theme song](https://github.com/awslabs/lambda-runcommand-configuration-management#theme-song).

## whodis
https://github.com/irlrobot/whodis

Automatically detect the programming language(s) present in a source code directory. Useful as a library for other projects that want to do automatic configuration. I originally built this for, and intended to use it with, my [wings](https://github.com/irlrobot/portfolio#wings) project before I decided on a different configuration system.

## alppb
https://github.com/irlrobot/alppb

The Amazon Linux Python Package Builder (alppb) builds Python packages using the same version of Amazon Linux that the AWS Lambda service uses. Using alppb helps guarantee that any PyPI package your AWS Lambda app depends on will run properly. This is largely a portfolio project as it's a pretty overkill solution. Nevertheless, it's a great little project that showcases my ability to work with Python and AWS. It's also on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/alppb/).

## Alexa Skills
If you've been living under a rock for a while, Amazon makes a "virtual assistant" called Alexa and [a bunch of hardware devices](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-And-Alexa-Devices/b?node=9818047011). Customers can enable "skills" which are basically apps for Alexa. [Amazon lets anyone create a skill](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa). I wrote a few.

### Unofficial MLB Game Info
https://www.amazon.com/Rebuke-The-Net-Unofficial-Game/dp/B06XBYXKH9

https://github.com/irlrobot/mlb_game_info

This is my most popular skill during baseball season. I had to use "unofficial" in the name since I apparently don't represent Major League Baseball. It grabs the latest scores and next game for each team and puts that data into the format that Flash Briefing skills require. Customers enable the feed for each team they follow.

### Train My Brain
https://www.amazon.com/Rebuke-The-Net-Train-Brain/dp/B073PRW6SB

https://github.com/irlrobot/train_my_brain

A "brain training" game. It still helps pay for my AWS bill :) Just say "Alexa, play train my brain."

### Code Word
https://www.amazon.com/Rebuke-The-Net-Code-Word/dp/B077S3DCKN

https://github.com/irlrobot/code_word

A game similar to the old Password gameshow or the game that Jimmy Fallon plays sometimes. Just say "Alexa, play Code Word."

## Dockerfiles
https://github.com/irlrobot/dockerfiles

My collection of Dockerfiles. Largley uninteresting, but these days I do tend to do development exclusively using Docker.

# Other Content
I have a personal blog at https://userdel.com that was recently resurrected but still neglected.

I wrote a few blog posts for AWS when I worked for them between Oct 2015 and Oct 2018:
* [Terraform: Beyond the Basics with AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/terraform-beyond-the-basics-with-aws/)
* [Automatically Delete Terminated Instances in Chef Server with AWS Lambda and CloudWatch Events](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/automatically-delete-terminated-instances-in-chef-server-with-aws-lambda-and-cloudwatch-events/)
* [AWS Sample Integrations for Atlassian Bitbucket Pipelines](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/aws-sample-integrations-for-atlassian-bitbucket-pipelines/)

I really don't like public speaking but I did it a few times for internal AWS events and once publicly at ChefConf 2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWhiWB87Wok&t=.
